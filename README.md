🖥️ Frontend (Vue.js)
The frontend is a single-page Vue.js 3 app that:

Lists all notes (with user names)

Allows note creation via a form (select user, input title/body)

Uses localStorage to store auth tokens

Handles routing using Vue Router (/ for login, /dashboard for main UI)

🔐 Authentication
Basic fake login token is stored in localStorage for routing purposes.

Logout clears the token and redirects to login.
